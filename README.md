# The-Snake-Game

A simple recreation of the classic Snake game, developed using Python as part of the 100 Days of Python course by Angela Yu. Navigate the snake, eat the food, and avoid the walls and your own tail!

Project Overview
main.py: The main script that sets up the game window, initializes the snake, food, and scoreboard, and runs the game loop.
snake.py: Contains the Snake class, which handles the creation, movement, and growth of the snake.
food.py: Defines the Food class, responsible for generating food at random locations for the snake to eat.
scoreboard.py: Manages the game score and displays it on the screen.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
